# MBSE Project: General Overview
In the final project, you are to model a larger system with your group.
At the end of the semester,
you are expected to submit a model of your system
and documentation written in Markdown.
You are also expected to present an interim status of your project
in a presentation at the end of the lecture period.
The assessment of the project is included in your final grade for this module.
The project is assessed on the basis of the model,
the documentation, and the presentation.
You will find detailed quality criteria for each below.

## Model Criteria
- The degree of detail used in your model should fit the task at hand.
Model important concepts but avoid technical detail.
- The model should be free of syntactic errors.
Make sure that your pipeline is green.
- Validate your model.
If applicable, write tests for your model as a whole and its components.
Do not forget to check for edge cases.
- The model should be readable.
  - Each model element shall have a meaningful name.
  - The model artifact should be uniformly formatted;
  Do not use too many empty lines,
  use 2 spaces (and no tabs) for indentation,
  sort the model elements the same way in each artifact, etc.
  - Document your model!
- Structure your model and your project.
Use packages and decompose your model into reasonable-sized components.
- Identify units of reuse and avoid redundant implementations.
- The parts of the model should be reusable and extendable.
- Use the languages to their full extent:
If there is a problem that is directly solvable
by using language elements for this purpose,
then do not reinvent a new solution.

## Markdown Documentation Criteria
- The model itself is described;
  - What is the goal/use of the model?
  - What are the assumptions made, and what has been the main focus?
  - What has not been modeled?
  - Why has it been modeled like this?
  - Which model elements have been created
  and how do they relate to each other?
- Write in such that someone not knowing anything about the project
will understand what the project is about and may start working with it,
modifying it, reusing parts, etc.
You can assume that they know the modeling languages.
- The markdown documentation is unrelated to the comments in the code.
Albeit, they may reference each other.
- There is no expected length for the documentation.
This is severely dependent on the project, you can aim for 3000 â€“ 18000 words:
  - If the comments in the model are very thorough,
  it can be enough to write a brief markdown file providing a broad overview.
  - If your project focusing on you researching the topics
  and creating an extremely small model in which you were to reason
  about different possible approaches for each model element,
  then the description and evaluation of the alternatives
  can be part of the markdown documentation.
  In this case,
  the markdown documentation may be several times as big as the model itself.

## Presentation Criteria
- The goal of the presentation is to give everyone an overview of your project.
Present your current progress,
as well as what you want to achieve until the end of the project.
- The presentation is about the content of the project.
Do not focus on technical details or technical problems.
- The presentations will be at the end of January/start of February
over the course of several days during the times of the MBSE lecture slots.
- You are only required to come to the lecture slot
where you hold your presentation.
However, attendance is required for the full lecture slot,
not just during your presentation.
- Feel free to come to the other presentations.
- The presentation should be in the range of 10-15 minutes
 with an additional 5 minutes of questions.
- It is not required of everyone in your group to talk.
